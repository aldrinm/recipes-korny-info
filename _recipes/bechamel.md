ingredients:
- 600ml milk
- a few slices of onion
- 1bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp black peppercorns
- 35g butter, plus extra for dotting on top if needed
- 35g plain four
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- freshly grated nutmeg (optional)
directions:
- Bring the milk to the boil in a pan with the onion, bay leaf and peppercorns, then simmer for 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to infuse for 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, in another pan, melt the butter, add the flour, stir to combine and cook over a low heat for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally (the resulting paste is called a roux in restaurant kitchens)
- Strain out the flavourings from the milk. Make sure that both the milk and roux are hot, then start gradually adding the milk to the roux, using a whisk. Whisk vigorously to make sure that no lumps form. (If you do get lumps, not to worry - they will often whisk out, or you can just strain the sauce through a fine sieve, pushing all the bits through, and begin whisking again in a new pan).
- Cook the sauce very slowly for 15-20 minutes, stirring until it has thickened and is velvety
- Season with salt and pepper to your taste. Some recipes using bechamel are good with a little pinch of grated nutmeg
- If not using straight away, dot the top of the sauce with butter or cover with a piece of baking paper to stop a skin forming
