tags: mains indian british-indian

ingredients:
- 200ml rapeseed oil
- 1 bay leaf
- 5cm cinnamon stick
- 3 black cardamom pods (or 6 green), bruised
- 1.5 tsp cumin seeds
- 1.5 tsp coriander seeds
- 2 star anise
- 3 large onions, finely chopped
- 4 tbsp mixed garlic and ginger paste
- 4 tomatoes, diced
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1.5 tsp bassar curry marsala
- 1 tbsp chilli powder
- 1.5 kg lamb leg or shoulder, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tbsp plain yoghurt
- salt

directions:
- Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat
- When the oil is visibly hot, add the bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom pods, cumin and coriander seeds and the star anise and temper the spices in the oil for about 30 seconds
- Add the chopped onions and fry for about 5-10 minutes until soft and lightly browned
- Stir in the garlic and ginger paste and fry for a further 30 seconds
- Now stir in the tomatoes, turmeric, bassar, if using, and chilli powder. Add the meat and brown for a few minutes, then pour in just enough water to cover. Simmer the lamb for 40 minutes - 1 hour until it is good and tender. Don't rush this! If after an hour the meat is not tender enough, cook it longer. The curry is ready when the meat is tender and the oil rises to the top. (I usually skim off the oil.)
- To finish, stir in the yoghurt, 1 tablespoon at a time. It will hardly be noticeably in the sauce but thickens and adds flavour to it. Check for seasoning and add salt to taste, then serve.

NOTE: If you can't find bassar, you might want to add a little more chilli powder, but I suggest adding it at the end of cooking to taste

Tested using the instant-pot - and I forgot to thicken with yoghurt!  The taste was great.
