ingredients:
- vegetable oil, for greasing
- 1/2 recipe of basic bread dough made up to step 5 of the method
- 75g unsalted butter, softened
- 75g light muscovado sugar
- 1 heaped dsp ground cinnamon
- 100g raisins
- sugar syrup to brush over the cooked snail bread (50g sugar/50g of water brought to the boil in a small pan and left to cool)
directions:
- See [Basic Bread](basic-bread.html) for the initial stages
- Roll out the dough on a lightly oiled work surface to an oblong (A3 size and 1cm thick).
- Put the butter, sugar and cinnamon into a pan over a gentle heat and stir together until melted. Spoon the buttery mix all over the rolled-out dough.
- Distribute the raisins evenly over the buttery dough.
- Roll the dough - landscape view - up into a long worm. With a sharp knife cut the dough "sausage" into 12 thick slices.
- Place the whirly slices of dough, cut side up, touching and side by side, in rows of 3 or 4 on a greased and lined baking tray.
- Lightly cover with a clean damp tea-towel and leave to prove for 30-45 minutes.
- Meanwhile preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.
- Put the tray of buns into the oven and cook for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C/gas mark 4 and cook for a further 25 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and brush the buns with the sugar syrup while still hot. Leave to cool on the tray. Best eaten on the day.
