This soup is called ribollita (reboiled) because it was originally made using the previous day's leftover vegetable
soup heated in an earthenware pot with thinly sliced onion,
black pepper and olive oil sprinkled on the surface.

Serves 4

Note - This should adapt very easily to a pressure cooker - I haven't tried yet though.
