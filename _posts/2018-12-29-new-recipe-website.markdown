I'm starting a new website for my recipes - well, not really my recipes, but recipes I like
and want to have available for browsing when out and about.

I have two main use cases:

1. Inspiration - when I want to plan a meal, it's handy to be able to browse my favourites
and say "hey, I forgot that awesome aubergine curry recipe, I should make that tomorrow"

2. Shopping - when I'm buying ingredients for that awesome aubergine curry, I'd like to be
able to look at the ingredients list to make sure I remember what it needs

Often I'll cheat and just upload a picture of the recipe - most of my favourite recipes are in books.
I have a toddler so am very starved for time! But the goal is to eventually evolve this into a
genuinely useful site.
