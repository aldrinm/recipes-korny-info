This is Korny's personal recipe site - it should be hosted at (http://recipes.korny.info)

Recipe metadata should match the [recipe schema](https://schema.org/Recipe)

## Tags

Some specific tag usages:

#### incomplete
These are recipes that need transcribing from images or sources into proper text

#### untested
These are recipes I've never actually tested - use with caution.

## Technical

You can find the source code on Github at (https://github.com/kornysietsma/recipes-korny-info)

It is based on a very basic Jekyll site, plus some clever recipe metadata management I copied from [chowdown](https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown)

I used to know more about CSS than I do now - but I have no time and don't keep up to date,
so I'll probably just stick to out-of-the-box themes for styling.

(I'm not using the chowdown theme as it is in a bit of flux at the moment, and
I care more about content than style!)

## TODO

- fix the recipe.html template with actual styling - the chowdown styles do no harm, but they don't add much but confusion
- consider moving the "untested" recipes into a separate category or something? It's a bit messy to just use tags for everything
