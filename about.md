This is Korny's personal recipe site - it should be hosted at http://recipes.korny.info

You can find the source code on Github at https://github.com/kornysietsma/recipes-korny-info

It is based on a very basic Jekyll site, plus some clever recipe metadata management I copied from [chowdown](https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown)

Recipe metadata should match the [recipe schema](https://schema.org/Recipe)

I used to know more about CSS than I do now - but I have no time and don't keep up to date,
so I'll probably just stick to out-of-the-box themes for styling.

(I'm not using the chowdown theme as it is in a bit of flux at the moment, and
I care more about content than style!)
